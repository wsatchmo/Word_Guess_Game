A game of hangman for your Pip-boy!

Change the background image in the **body** area of the css (and in the *images* foler) and the font or text color in the **p** area of the css to make a theme of your own. The css tags of the buttons are **start-game** and **music** (they are labelled in the css).

For re-theming the words used, change the values in the array **wordArr** in the JavaScript. If you add characters other than letters, you'll want to add these to the array **possibilitiesArr** as well.

And finally, you'll want to change the song (which is found in the *music* folder) by linking a new file in the  *input* section of the html with an id of **music**.
